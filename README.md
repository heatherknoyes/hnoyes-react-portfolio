The motivation for this project was to create a new portfolio of all of my personal projects using React instead of plain HTML/CSS. You can see many of my different pieces of work that are added to consistently. Enjoy learning more about me and soon I will allow for submitting some feedback with time! Thank you for supporting my career journey.
